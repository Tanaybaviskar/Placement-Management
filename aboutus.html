                <p>
                    PDPM IIITDM Jabalpur was the third Indian Institute of Technology, established on January 24, 2005 by the Ministry of Education (India) under Madhya Pradesh Society Registration Act 1973.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The foundation stone of the Institute was laid by Late Shri Arjun Singh, the then Minister of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on February 7, 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On May 3, 2006, a land of 250 acres near Dumna Airport of Jabalpur was identified by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh and was handed over to the Institute. Construction work of Phase I buildings was started in 2007 and was completed in 2009.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first academic session of PDPM IIITDM Jabalpur started from August 2005 from the campus of Jabalpur Engineering College until its own permanent campus was ready. The Institute started operating from the temporary location at the IT Bhawan of the Jabalpur Engineering College. Professor Sanjay G. Dhande, Director, IIT Kanpur was given the additional charge as the Director of the Institute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The institute was allotted 260 acres (1.1 km²) in close proximity to the Jabalpur Airport and Dumna Nature Reserve Park, in 2006 following the appointment of Dr. Sanjeev Bhargava as director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Construction of the Phase-I buildings (Core-Lab-Complex and Residential-Hostels) started thereafter and was completed in June 2009.
